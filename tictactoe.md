Hereâ€™s a Low-Level Design (LLD) code for a Tic-Tac-Toe game that supports multiple games being played simultaneously. The system allows players to create games, join games, and play moves concurrently. To handle multiple games, each game has its own instance, and moves are synchronized per game to ensure consistency.

### Design Overview
1. **Game**: Manages the state of the board, players, and game status.
2. **Player**: Represents each player with their symbol (X or O).
3. **GameManager**: Responsible for creating and managing multiple games, tracking game instances and allowing moves.
4. **Concurrency**: Synchronization is handled at the `Game` level to allow multiple games to proceed concurrently without conflicts.

### Full Code

#### Enum: `Symbol`
Represents player symbols, either X or O.

```java
enum Symbol {
    X, O;
}
```

#### Class: `Player`
Represents a player with a symbol.

```java
class Player {
    private final String name;
    private final Symbol symbol;

    public Player(String name, Symbol symbol) {
        this.name = name;
        this.symbol = symbol;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public Symbol getSymbol() {
        return symbol;
    }
}
```

#### Enum: `GameStatus`
Represents the game status.

```java
enum GameStatus {
    IN_PROGRESS, X_WINS, O_WINS, DRAW;
}
```

#### Class: `Game`
This class represents an individual game. It maintains the game board, current player, game status, and handles moves.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Game {
    private final Player playerX;
    private final Player playerO;
    private final Symbol[][] board;
    private GameStatus status;
    private Player currentPlayer;
    private final int boardSize = 3;

    public Game(Player playerX, Player playerO) {
        this.playerX = playerX;
        this.playerO = playerO;
        this.board = new Symbol[boardSize][boardSize];
        this.status = GameStatus.IN_PROGRESS;
        this.currentPlayer = playerX;
    }

    // Get game status
    public GameStatus getStatus() {
        return status;
    }

    // Switch turns between players
    private void switchTurn() {
        currentPlayer = (currentPlayer == playerX) ? playerO : playerX;
    }

    // Handle a player making a move
    public synchronized boolean playMove(int row, int col) {
        if (status != GameStatus.IN_PROGRESS) {
            System.out.println("Game has already ended.");
            return false;
        }
        if (row < 0 || col < 0 || row >= boardSize || col >= boardSize || board[row][col] != null) {
            System.out.println("Invalid move. Try again.");
            return false;
        }

        board[row][col] = currentPlayer.getSymbol();
        printBoard();

        if (checkWin(row, col)) {
            status = (currentPlayer.getSymbol() == Symbol.X) ? GameStatus.X_WINS : GameStatus.O_WINS;
            System.out.println("Player " + currentPlayer.getName() + " wins!");
        } else if (isBoardFull()) {
            status = GameStatus.DRAW;
            System.out.println("The game is a draw.");
        } else {
            switchTurn();
        }
        return true;
    }

    // Check if board is full
    private boolean isBoardFull() {
        return Arrays.stream(board).allMatch(row -> Arrays.stream(row).allMatch(cell -> cell != null));
    }

    // Check if the current player has won
    private boolean checkWin(int row, int col) {
        Symbol symbol = currentPlayer.getSymbol();

        // Check row, column, and diagonals
        return checkRow(row, symbol) || checkColumn(col, symbol) || checkDiagonals(symbol);
    }

    private boolean checkRow(int row, Symbol symbol) {
        return Arrays.stream(board[row]).allMatch(cell -> cell == symbol);
    }

    private boolean checkColumn(int col, Symbol symbol) {
        return Arrays.stream(board).map(row -> row[col]).allMatch(cell -> cell == symbol);
    }

    private boolean checkDiagonals(Symbol symbol) {
        boolean leftDiagonal = true, rightDiagonal = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < boardSize; i++) {
            if (board[i][i] != symbol) leftDiagonal = false;
            if (board[i][boardSize - 1 - i] != symbol) rightDiagonal = false;
        }
        return leftDiagonal || rightDiagonal;
    }

    // Print the board
    private void printBoard() {
        for (Symbol[] row : board) {
            for (Symbol cell : row) {
                System.out.print((cell == null ? "." : cell) + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Class: `GameManager`
The `GameManager` class manages multiple games, allowing players to create and play games concurrently.

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.UUID;

class GameManager {
    private final Map<String, Game> games = new HashMap<>();

    // Start a new game and return the game ID
    public String createGame(Player playerX, Player playerO) {
        Game newGame = new Game(playerX, playerO);
        String gameId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
        games.put(gameId, newGame);
        System.out.println("Game created with ID: " + gameId);
        return gameId;
    }

    // Play a move in a specific game
    public boolean playMove(String gameId, int row, int col) {
        Game game = games.get(gameId);
        if (game == null) {
            System.out.println("Invalid game ID.");
            return false;
        }
        return game.playMove(row, col);
    }

    // Check game status
    public GameStatus getGameStatus(String gameId) {
        Game game = games.get(gameId);
        if (game == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid game ID.");
        }
        return game.getStatus();
    }
}
```

#### Main Class: `TicTacToeApp`
This is the entry point of the application, demonstrating multiple games being created and played concurrently.

```java
public class TicTacToeApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GameManager gameManager = new GameManager();

        // Create players
        Player player1 = new Player("Alice", Symbol.X);
        Player player2 = new Player("Bob", Symbol.O);
        Player player3 = new Player("Charlie", Symbol.X);
        Player player4 = new Player("Dave", Symbol.O);

        // Create multiple games
        String game1Id = gameManager.createGame(player1, player2);
        String game2Id = gameManager.createGame(player3, player4);

        // Play moves in Game 1
        new Thread(() -> gameManager.playMove(game1Id, 0, 0)).start();
        new Thread(() -> gameManager.playMove(game1Id, 0, 1)).start();
        new Thread(() -> gameManager.playMove(game1Id, 1, 0)).start();
        new Thread(() -> gameManager.playMove(game1Id, 1, 1)).start();
        new Thread(() -> gameManager.playMove(game1Id, 2, 0)).start();

        // Play moves in Game 2
        new Thread(() -> gameManager.playMove(game2Id, 0, 0)).start();
        new Thread(() -> gameManager.playMove(game2Id, 1, 1)).start();
        new Thread(() -> gameManager.playMove(game2Id, 2, 2)).start();
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code
- **Game Class**: Each game instance represents a separate Tic-Tac-Toe game, with thread-safe `playMove` to allow concurrent moves.
- **GameManager Class**: Manages multiple games by creating unique game instances using UUIDs.
- **Concurrency**: Each game runs independently, and moves can be executed in parallel through threads in the main application.

### Conclusion
This code allows multiple Tic-Tac-Toe games to run simultaneously, with each game handling its state and moves independently, using concurrency control at the game level.
